This is a simple MERN app where the user could log their workouts and keep track of them. 
Eacher user needs to have an account that they could log in to by providing their userName and password, otherwise you can not enter or access any workout data. Implementing this authentication code, helped us get enhance our server side knowledge and how to implement secured routes. 

We used React for our frontend code and redux for some components too. We got to understand better how we react allows us to break down our page sections into different components that interact among each other and we used redux to implement a more global state management.

We look forward to adding more features to this app, where a user will automatically see their total time workout on their userprofile page and change exercise description to a dropdown where the user picks workout name rather than typing it and adding more styling.
