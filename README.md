# fitness-tracker-backend

This is a simple MERN app where the user can log their workouts and keep track of them. Each user needs to have an account they will log in to by providing their user mame and password. Otherwise you can not enter or access any workout data. Implementing this authentication code helped us enhance our server side knowledge and how to implement secured routes.

We used React for our frontend code and redux for some components too. We got to understand better how we react allows us to break down our page sections into different components that interact among each other and we used redux to implement a more flexible state management globally.

We look forward to adding more features to this app, where a user will automatically see their total time workout on their userprofile page and change exercise description to a dropdown where the user can have an avatar, pick their workout name rather than typing it and adding more styling.

For now we got a few main issues to work on for the deployed appication, when you register a new user, it logs you in automatically but you can not see your username nor the activity date you enter at the time until you log out and log in again, also when logged in and you enter new activity data, you need to reload the page to see it, and if you are not logged in and go to userprofile it takes you to a blank page. We are looking forward to fixing these major issues.

This is the link to our repository where we pushed and committed our work progressively but it's not the same one we deployed, because the json files got confusing and we had to make two new ones for deployment.
